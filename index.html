	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born in Matamoros Tamaulipas, raised in Chapel Hill NC.<br> During my time in the states, I studied and worked at an Asian restaurant called <a href="http://lanternrestaurant.com" target= "_blank"><em> "The Lantern"</em></a>.<br> I had other jobs as well, including landscaping, and factory. I have younger brother that is 13 years old.</p>

	<p> The reason I chose to start a career in programming is because there is a such a high demand of positions available<br> and so little amount of people who study it.  Also, because I think it's cool to be a part of the next generation of people developming the Internet.  </p>
